# Notes

Some things I would have liked to do if I had more time:
 - Fix loading spinner to avoid jerky logo loading. 
 - Seperate scss file with reusable variables for things like colors.
 - Create a social media component to incapsulate the social media icon links.
 - Seperate component creating a card with a border for the description content.
 - Add a footer component. 
 - Ability to load different teams dynamically by searching using the API. 

 # Run the app
    - Install Node v12.18.4 and NPM v6.14.6.
    - Navigate to the root folder (package.json should been in the root).
    - Run npm install.
    - Run npm run start.
